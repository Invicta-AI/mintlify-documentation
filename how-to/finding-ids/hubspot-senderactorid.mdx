<Info>
  To enable an agent to send messages through HubSpot, you need to include the
  Sender Actor ID in the agent's system message or request. The agent will send
  messages on behalf of the actor whose ID is used.

        alt="HubSpot Organization Menu"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When using the Sender Actor ID, you must include it in the format "A-[NUMBER]"
  (where A stands for actor) in the system message for the tool to work
  properly.
</Warning>

For example, if your ID is 123456, you would use: `A-123456`
