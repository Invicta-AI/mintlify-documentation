<Info>
  This feature is available exclusively for Pro, Business, and Enterprise
  customers.
</Info>

The Widget and Embed feature allows you to integrate your Invicta AI agent into a
chat widget or an embed window on your website. This enables users to interact with
your agent directly on your site, without the need for sign-up, providing a seamless
experience similar to the ChatUI on the Invicta AI platform.

## Functionality

The agent within the widget/embed functions similarly to the regular ChatUI, capable of:

- Responding to queries
- Using tools
- Invoking AI teammates

<Note>
  **Key differences in widget/embed functionality:** <br />
  1. **Steps** like "Knowledge Base retrieved", tool uses, or AI teammate invocations
  are not displayed.

2. **Credits** for agent usage within the widget are deducted from the agent's
   author, not the end-user.
   </Note>

## Analytics

- You can view chat logs with your agents in the analytics page.
- Monitor agent usage across all platforms (widget, Invicta AI platform, etc.) in the analytics page.
