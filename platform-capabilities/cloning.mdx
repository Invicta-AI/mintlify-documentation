Cloning allows users to duplicate AI agents and their configurations. This functionality enables instant deployment and customisation of AI agents.

## What Gets Cloned

When you clone an AI agent, the following elements are duplicated:

- Knowledge base (files)
- System message
- LLM parameters
- Other configurations

<Info>
  Cloning creates an exact copy of the original agent's setup, providing a quick
  starting point for customization or deployment.
</Info>

## Cloning and Visibility

The ability to clone an AI agent is governed by two key settings:

1. **Open Source Setting**: Determines if others can clone your AI agent.
2. **Visibility Setting**: Controls who can access your AI agent.

<Note>
  If your AI agent's visibility is set to private, it cannot be cloned by
  others, regardless of the open source setting. Private agents are not visible
  to other users.
</Note>

## How to Clone an Individual Agent

There are two methods to clone an individual agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Via Agent Info Modal">
    Open the agent's info modal and click the "Clone" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Via ChatUI">
    Within the ChatUI, click the clone button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cloning Agent Teams

If an agent has AI teammates and is open source, you have the option to clone either the individual agent or the entire Agent Team.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Info Modal">Open the agent's info modal.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose Cloning Option">
    Select whether to clone the individual agent or the entire Agent Team.

        className="rounded-xl"
        alt="Clone Agent Team"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  When cloning an entire agent team, every agent within the team will be cloned.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Only "downstream" agents (those to whom the current agent delegates, and their
  subsequent delegates) will be cloned. "Upstream" agents (those that delegate
  to the current agent) will not be cloned.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  To share a complete team of agents for cloning, share the most upstream agent.
</Tip>

## Controlling Cloning Permissions

The ability to clone an agent is determined by its "Open Source" or "Closed Source" status.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agent Builder">
    Open the Agent Builder when creating or editing an agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Advanced Options">
    Find the "Advanced Options" section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Source Status">
    Choose between "Open Source" or "Closed Source" and save the Agent.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/platform-capabilities/clone-options.png"
        className="rounded-xl"
        alt="Clone Options"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>By default, agents are set to "Open Source".</Note>
