Triggers in Invicta AI enable agents to process requests automatically based on predefined conditions, without requiring manual user input. This feature component allows AI Agents to function autonomously, respond to events, and execute tasks proactively without constant human oversight.

## How Triggers Work

When a trigger condition is met, it sends a message to the associated agent. The agent then processes this message similarly to how it handles user inputs in the ChatUI, capable of generating responses, using tools, or invoking AI teammates as needed.

<Note>
  Most triggers send the agent a message specified in the trigger's content
  (e.g., email or message content). However, some triggers like "Scheduler" send
  a predefined instruction to the agent.
</Note>

## Available Triggers

Invicta AI offers a range of triggers to automate various workflows:

| Trigger Name              | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheduler                 | Executes tasks at specified times or intervals                              |
| Webhook                   | Responds to HTTP POST requests, enabling integration with external services |
| Gmail Mail Received       | Activates when a new email is received in a Gmail account                   |
| Outlook Mail Received     | Activates when a new email is received in an Outlook account                |
| HubSpot Incoming Messages | Responds to new messages or events in HubSpot CRM                           |

## Monitoring Trigger-Initiated Threads

Threads initiated by triggers appear in the sidebar's thread list.

<Info>
  Unread threads are indicated by a white dot next to the thread title. Opening
  the thread marks it as read and removes the dot.
</Info>

## Pausing Triggers

Users have the ability to pause and resume agent triggers as needed:

1. Locate the agent's trigger within the chat UI on the right-hand side.
2. Click on the trigger to toggle between paused and live states.

When a trigger is paused, the agent will not respond to that specific trigger until it is reactivated.

<Info>
  Each trigger has a colored bubble next to it: <br />
  1. **Green bubble**: The trigger is
  live and active.

2. **Red bubble**: The trigger is paused and inactive.
  </Info>

## Sharing Agents with Triggers

When sharing an agent that has a trigger function:

- Other users cannot directly "Chat" with the agent.
- They can only "Clone" the agent to use it.

<Warning>
  An AI agent with a trigger function that is closed source (not clonable by
  others) can only be private. To share such an agent, either make it open
  source (clonable) or remove the trigger function.
</Warning>

By leveraging triggers, you can create more responsive and autonomous AI agents, capable of handling complex workflows without constant manual intervention. This autonomy allows your AI workforce to operate continuously, responding to events and executing tasks around the clock, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and responsiveness in your organization.
