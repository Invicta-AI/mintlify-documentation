AI agents use memories to provide more contextually relevant responses by learning from your past interactions. This intelligent system automatically identifies and retains important information from your conversations.

## Features

- **Automatic Learning**: Intelligently identifies and saves notable information from conversations
- **Context Enhancement**: Adds relevant memories to conversations like system messages
- **Smart Management**: Updates and consolidates related memories automatically
- **Privacy Focused**: Maintains user-specific memory bases for enhanced security

## Memory Controls

### Checking Memory Status

Look for the brain icon in the agent's UI:

- ðŸŸ¢ Green indicator: Memory is enabled
- ðŸ”´ Red indicator: Memory is disabled

    <img src="/ai-agents/memory1.png" alt="Memory Indicator" />
  </Frame>

### Managing Memories

You can control the memory system in two ways:

1. **Tool Management**: Add or remove memory as an agent tool
2. **Quick Toggle**: Use the memory management dialog via the brain icon

## Privacy & Limitations

### Personal Memory Space

- Each user has their own private memory base
- Memories are only accessible to the user who created them
- Agents maintain separate memories for each user

  The legacy memory feature has been deprecated. Your existing memories remain
  available in your agent's knowledge base.
