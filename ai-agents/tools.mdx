Tools are external functions or APIs that AI agents can use to perform specific tasks or access additional information, extending their capabilities beyond language processing.

## Important Considerations

<Tip>
**Tip**

While we do not limit the number of tools you can add to agents, adding fewer
tools often results in better performance. Carefully consider which tools will
best serve your agent's purpose to optimize its efficiency.

</Tip>

<Note>
**Running Tools in Parallel**

Our platform supports running multiple tools in parallel, allowing agents to perform several tasks simultaneously. This capability ensures that tasks are completed faster and more efficiently.

</Note>

<Note>
**Hidden Prompt**

Each added tool also includes a hidden prompt sent with every request of the
agent. This can affect the agent's response and consume more Compute Points
per request. The hidden prompt includes the tool's name, description, JSON schema,
and other components necessary for the agent to understand and use the tool effectively.

</Note>

<Note>
  **Tool Use Failure and Retrying**

When tool use fails, agents have the ability to retry using the tool. To
encourage or prevent this behavior, you can instruct it to keep retrying or
not in the system message.

</Note>

<Warning>
**Max Iterations**

As a safety precaution, there is a max iterations cap at 15. If an agent calls
a single tool 15 times, either simultaneously or after retries, it will be
automatically stopped.

</Warning>

## Tool Structure

A tool consists of:

- The name of the tool.
- A description of what the tool does.
- A JSON schema defining the inputs to the tool.
- A function (and, optionally, an async variant of the function).

When a tool is bound to a model, the name, description, and JSON schema are provided as context to the model. Given a list of tools and a set of instructions, a model can request to call one or more tools with specific inputs.
