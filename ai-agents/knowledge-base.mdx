The Knowledge Base is a repository where various types of data are stored and managed to support the intelligence and responsiveness of AI agents. It contains structured and unstructured data including text documents, spreadsheets, web links, and other file types, which can be leveraged by the agents for various purposes.

### Key Features:

- **Data Variety Support**: The Knowledge Base accepts a wide array of file formats such as PDF, CSV, TXT, and others.
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Certain data sources like Google Drive are directly integrated to reflect any changes instantaneously.
- **Agent-Specific Silos**: Data can be sectioned into silos per agent, restricting access and preventing unintended sharing of sensitive information.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The system employs mechanisms for self-improvement by regularly updating indexing, retrieval, generation, and action success metrics.

<Tip>
  Note: If files within the AI Agent's Knowledge Base are large, it will only
  retrieve chunks from it. To use the entire file, you can either: 
  1. Attach the
  file in the chat, which will use the whole document. 
  2. In the chat, use the "@" to mention
  specific knowledge base files, which will again, use the whole file.

## Real-Time Synchronization

One of the paramount features of our Knowledge Base is its capability to stay in sync with connected data sources like Google Drive. When updates or modifications are made to files within these sources, our platform ensures that these changes are mirrored promptly in the Knowledge Base. This feature ensures that AI agents are operating with the most up-to-date information available without manual intervention.

## Managing Your Knowledge Base

1.  Click the 'Knowledge Base' button in your AI Agent chat interface or go to the AI Agent Builder.

    />
3.  Enable the specific knowledge base entries you want this AI Agent to access and click "Save changes". Note that the Agent will only be aware of the files you have enabled for it.

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Base is an essential tool that empowers AI Agents with relevant and current information required for responding to queries and performing tasks effectively. With real-time synchronization capabilities like those with Google Drive, users can rest assured that their agents are always informed with the most recent data.
